Title: Analyzing Correlations Between Suicide Rates and Median Household
Income in Colorado Counties

Income is often a large stressor for people all over the country. This
increase in stress can cause a decline in one’s mental health, and in
turn, lead someone to commit suicide. Income and suicide rates have been
linked in research for quite a long time. There is evidence that higher
income and more income security are associated with lower rates of
suicide, and vice versa (@Shields-Zeeman2022). Additionally, over 75% of
global suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries (@Lemmi2016).
Providing income security through policies like debt relief, increased
minimum wages, and tax credits has been shown to decrease mental health
stress for families and individuals (@Shields-Zeeman2022). Analyzing the
correlation between suicide and income is not new, but taking a closer
look at Colorado counties will allow for more specific policy-making
actions to take place within the state and its counties.

Research objective/question/hypothesis: The research objective is to
look at the correlation of suicide rates to the median household income
of Colorado counties. The hypothesis is that counties with lower incomes
will have higher suicide rates than those with higher incomes. Some
analyses that could be used to test this hypothesis include performing a
correlation analysis and using a simple linear regression model.

Proposed Methods: This study will use one data set from the Colorado
Department of Public Health
([data](https://cohealthviz.dphe.state.co.us/t/HealthInformaticsPublic/views/COVDRSSuicideDashboardAllYearsExcludesRace/Story1?%3Aembed=y&%3Aiid=1&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y))
and one from the National Institute of Health
([data](https://hdpulse.nimhd.nih.gov/data-portal/social/map?socialtopic=030&socialtopic_options=social_6&demo=00011&demo_options=income_3&race=00&race_options=race_7&sex=0&sex_options=sexboth_1&age=001&age_options=ageall_1&statefips=08&statefips_options=area_states)).
The scope of this study will be spatial, focused specifically on
Colorado. The analysis will be conducted at the county level, as that
variable is present in both data sets and will be used to join the two
data sets together. Not all counties have suicide rate data, so those
will be filtered out during analysis. Some statistical tests that could
be used for analyzing the hypothesis are a correlation analysis and
either a T-test or Wilcoxon test depending on whether or not the data is
normally distributed.

Expected Outcomes: It is expected that counties with higher incomes will
have lower rates of suicide. Knowing this information is important, as
it provides insight into income status on mental health, and stresses
the importance of accessible mental health resources.

Title: Comparing Firearm Mortality to Firearm Ownership by State 

There is a notion that more firearms makes a country or state “safer”.
However, having more firearms per capita has been proven to worsen
mortality rates. Studies have shown that there is a significant,
positive correlation between firearm ownership and firearm mortality
rates (@hamilton2015firearms). This statistic has been heavily seen in
adolescents, as firearms are the second leading cause of pediatric death
in the US (@goyal2019state). Due to the surge in firearm mortality
deaths, there has been a large push in the US government to create
safer, more effective firearm laws that pertain to all states. Despite
the overwhelming evidence that more guns only leads to more deaths,
countries like the US still push the notion that having guns makes
everyone safer. Providing more insight into this relationship will
hopefully add to the evidence that firearm laws and firearm safety are
crucial to reduce mortality rates.

Research objective/question/hypothesis: The research objective is to
look at the correlation of firearm mortality to firearm ownership by
state. The hypothesis is that states with lower percentages of firearm
owners will have less firearm moralities. Some analyses that could be
used to test this hypothesis would be performing a correlation analysis
and using a simple linear regression model to visualize the correlation.

Proposed Methods: This study will use one data set from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention
([data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm))
and one from the World Population Review
([data](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/gun-ownership-by-state#sources)).
The scope of this study will be spatial, focused on the entire United
States. The analysis will be conducted at the state level, as that
variable is present in both data sets and will be used to join the two
data sets together. In the CDC data, state is classified as “location”,
while the WPR data classifies state as “state”, so some renaming of
variables will need to take place before these data sets can be joined
together. Once done, the data sets can be joined using the state names.
Some statistical tests that could be used for analyzing the hypothesis
are a Spearman or Pearson correlation depending on whether or not the
data is normally distributed. The normality would be tested using the
Shapiro test.

Expected Outcomes: It is expected that states with less firearm owners
will have less firearm moralities. This information would be useful in
helping law makers make decisions regarding gun laws and gun safety.

Title: Analyzing the Quantity of Different Pollutants in Colorado
Counties 

This project looks to expand upon prior research done in the field of
environmental injustice, specifically focused on the impact of unequal
distribution of polluting industries in urban communities, where it is
typically recorded that power plants, coal & waste burning facilities,
railroads, and more are built in urban communities, resulting in higher
quantities of pollutants (@aubourg2023community). It has been recorded
that higher rates of respiratory illness can occur as a consequence of
higher quantities of pollutants such as SO2 and NO2
(@kipterer2025spatiotemporal). Understanding this makes it important to
expand this work to Colorado communities to help us better understand
which counties could need more specific environmental policy and advised
behavior changes to improve local health. 

Research objective/question/hypothesis: Our specific objective through
this research project will be to determine if urban communities within
the Colorado region are victims of environmental injustice that other
communities in America are also victims too. We hypothesize that urban
counties in Colorado will have higher average quantities of pollutants,
CO, Ozone, NO2, and SO2 than non-urban counties. We aim to specifically
use chi-squared tests to determine if there is a uni-variate correlation
between urban counties and pollution levels. 

Proposed Methods: The region of focus will be within Colorado, where we
will take a combination of data from the US EPA that gives us data on
Colorado Counties on a specific pollutant, 4 data types will be used,
one for each of our desired pollutants, where then the data will be
filtered to only show for desired variables which are county, daily
observed count, county fips, Daily AQI value, and Lat & Long
coordinates. From here, county fips codes will be used to do a table
join to add our desired pollutants and their daily counts to a single
data set, where we can conduct chi-squared tests on our different
pollutants with county information to determine if there is a
relationship between county. Based on whether there is a relationship,
we can then plot our data using latitude and longitude data to
effectively describe where there is the most pollution in Colorado.

Expected Outcomes: It is expected that our research will find that there
are higher average concentrations of one of our 4 pollutants within
urban counties in Colorado. In turn, we hope to be able to attribute
deleterious health effects to this information to provide a starting
point for environmental justice reform in urban communities.

Title: Determining Causes for Lung Health Issues in Colorado Communities

Studies have shown that various greenhouse gas pollutants contribute to
increases in upper respiratory illnesses in various urban communities in
children under 5. Specific gases that contribute to upper respiratory
illness are SO2 and NO2 (@kipterer2025spatiotemporal). Other studies
have also found that high concentrations of pollutants in certain
communities have also been found to cause other respiratory illnesses
and be correlated to higher cancer rates (@aubourg2023community). Our
research seeks to determine if there is a relationship between
greenhouse gases CO2, Ozone, SO2, and NO2 and increased risk of health
issues such as asthma within the Colorado area. This research aims to
inform public policy to accommodate individuals who live in areas that
have higher concentration of these greenhouse gases in hopes that
lung-related health issues will decrease. 

Research objective/question/hypothesis: The objective of this study is
to determine if any greenhouse gases that our society currently emits
through pollution plants are related to any types of lung health-related
issues. We hypothesize that either SO2, NO2, CO2, or ozone will be
correlated to higher hospitalization and medical visit rates for
lung-related issues. 

Proposed Methods: The analysis will be conducted using a data set from
the American Lung Association which has information about incidences of
asthma, COPD, adult chronic lung disease, and lung cancer. US EPA data
will be filtered, and cleaned to provide a data set with our 4
greenhouse pollutants, their daily concentrations, API, and county
categories. From here, a full join will be used on our data sets to
allow for analysis. Our analysis will consist of a bivariate linear
regression to determine if there is a significant amount of reported
cases of lung health-related issues that can be attributed to one of our
4 pollutants, we will use our lung health-related issues as a response
variable, with our pollutants as our predictor variable. Normalization
methods such as recipes the Spearman method may also be used to
determine correlation and remove issues that may arise from unequal
distribution. From here, pubr tools will be used to create visual
graphics that visualize rates of lung health-related issues that were
proven to be attributed to one of our 4 pollutants, based on the
concentration of pollutants in specific counties.

Expected Outcomes: We expect that at least 1 of our 4 lung-related
health issues will be attributed to concentrations of one or more of our
greenhouse gases. It is important to understand this, as it can allow
for public policy to be specifically tailored to the immediate reduction
of these pollutants, as well as allowing for air monitoring technology
in Colorado to accurately record dangerous amounts of these pollutants
in the air on given days.

Title: Analyzing the Impacts of Urban Green Space on Mental Health

This project is significant in providing evidence for increased
implementation of urban green space, especially in U.S. cities. It has
been found that common stressors of living in an urban space can include
an overcrowded and polluted environment, increased levels of violence,
and diminished social support (@ventriglio2021urbanization). These
stressors are unique to the conditions of living in urban areas and can
be damaging to one’s mental health. If linked to an increase in mental
health benefits, urban green space may provide a way to counteract the
negative effects of urbanization. Urban green space already has many
ecological benefits including reduction of the heat island effect,
enhanced biodiversity, and carbon sequestration
(@zhang2024comprehensive). Considering the known ecological benefits of
urban green space, conducting this study will provide further evidence
to local government and city planners that urban green space can be
crucial in improving the mental health of residents and mitigating
against the stressors of urbanization.  

Research objective/question/hypothesis: The objective of this study is
to analyze how access to green space affects the mental health of
residents living in an urban environment. This will specifically be
based on mental health indicators such as rates of anxiety and
depression.

Proposed Methods: Focusing on New York City, New York as the region of
interest, this study will compare parks data
([data](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/mental-health/?id=2417#display=summary))
to mental health data
([data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Recreation/Parks-Properties/enfh-gkve/about_data)),
comparing the levels of depression and anxiety by zip code. More
specifically, this study will explore the impacts of urban green space
based on size of the space, and proximity. This data will be compared to
if green space impacts mental health in urban communities. This study
will use a spatial scale by identifying differences among different zip
codes within the same city. For statistical support we will use a
Chi-Square test and run a linear regression.

Expected Outcomes: Based on the research question, we expect to find
that residents who have greater access to green space in urban areas
will experience lower levels of depression than those with more limited
access. This outcome is important as it will encourage city planners and
municipal government leaders to implement more green space in dense
urban centers.

Title: Analyzing how Proximity and Type of Power Plant Affect Soil
Health 

This project is significant because of its environmental and social
implications. Environmentally, understanding how proximity to different
types of power plants can provide more information on soil degradation.
Currently, soil degradation is largely caused when pollutants such as
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and heavy metals enter the soil and
alter its chemical composition (@osman2013soil). Additionally, soil
degradation can lead to biodiversity loss and disrupt critical ecosystem
services. Proximity to power plants could also have human health impacts
as heavy metals and pollutants can enter the air and waterways, leading
to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and other medical
conditions (@barreira2017impacts). Having a greater awareness of how far
reaching the ecological and human health impacts of power plants are,
using soil health as an indicator, can create more educated land use
planning and permitting. Additionally, if this study reveals that coal
and natural gas power plants are causing soil degradation, the evidence
could be used to support the need for more clean energy sources. 

Research objective/question/hypothesis: A specific research question
that we aim to understand through this study is, how do soil pH and
organic content vary based on the proximity to power plants of different
energy sources (coal, natural gas, nuclear, etc.)? We want to analyze
how power plants are impacting the surrounding soil and how these
impacts may vary by energy source. 

Proposed Methods: We plan to carry out this study by narrowing the area
of interest down to the state of Texas because of its variety of energy
sources located within the state. Narrowing down the area of interest
also provides a more similar baseline for soil health when comparing
proximity to power plants. We plan to join the soil health data
([data](https://datasets.wri.org/datasets/global-power-plant-database?map=eyJ2aWV3U3RhdGUiOnsibG9uZ2l0dWRlIjotODkuNjk3NDg0ODY1NzAwOTMsImxhdGl0dWRlIjozMi41ODEzNjI4NTc0Mzk1Nywiem9vbSI6My45MTQ1NTgzMzk3NDcyMjIsInBpdGNoIjowLCJiZWFyaW5nIjowLCJwYWRkaW5nIjp7InRvcCI6MCwiYm90dG9tIjowLCJsZWZ0IjowLCJyaWdodCI6MH19LCJiYXNlbWFwIjoibGlnaHQiLCJib3VuZGFyaWVzIjpmYWxzZSwibGFiZWxzIjoiZGFyayIsImFjdGl2ZUxheWVyR3JvdXBzIjpbeyJkYXRhc2V0SWQiOiI1MzYyM2RmZC0zZGY2LTRmMTUtYTA5MS02NzQ1N2NkYjU3MWYiLCJsYXllcnMiOlsiMmE2OTQyODktZmVjOS00YmZlLWE2ZDItNTZjMzg2NGVjMzQ5Il19XSwiYm91bmRzIjp7ImJib3giOm51bGwsIm9wdGlvbnMiOnt9fSwibGF5ZXJzUGFyc2VkIjpbWyIyYTY5NDI4OS1mZWM5LTRiZmUtYTZkMi01NmMzODY0ZWMzNDkiLHsidmlzaWJpbGl0eSI6dHJ1ZSwiYWN0aXZlIjp0cnVlLCJvcGFjaXR5IjoxLCJ6SW5kZXgiOjExfV1dfQ%3D%3D))
and power plant data
([data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ncss-soil-characterization-database))
by Texas only. This study would be on a spatial scale as it is comparing
soil health based on geographic locations from a given power plant. We
would analyze factors such as soil pH, organic carbon content, soil
moisture, and the presence of heavy metals. In addition to proximity, We
would like to analyze how varying energy sources (coal, natural gas,
nuclear) impact these soil indicators differently. To test the
hypothesis, some statistics we would use include frequency distribution
to see how certain levels of the soil health indicators change in
relation to distance from power plants. We could also use linear
regression, t-test, and Chi-squared test.

Expected Outcomes: Based on the above research question, we predict that
coal power plants will lead to the most change within soil health.
Understanding the impacts of power plants on soil is necessary in
understanding how they contribute to soil degradation and if additional
protections can be put in place to help maintain soil health. Protecting
soil health is important as it contributes to nutrient cycling on a
larger scale.
